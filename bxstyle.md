To get a B/X feel consider using the following tradition and 5e variant rules.

Character Creation

* roll 3d6 for ability score in order
* select only from races and classes in the free D&D 5e Basic Rules
* use the DMG variant rule that grants characters proficiency in two abilities. This removes the use of skills from the game
* consider removing or limiting the use of cantrips
* every adventurer is given the standard adventuring gear pack
* may want to toss in some pitons and a 10ft pole
