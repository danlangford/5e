== Mass Combat

im interested in Coleville combat rules. we should see a lite version of those in his Strongholds rules he releases from his Kickstarter. Document has been obtained. Coleville has "opened" the licensing on the mass combat rules. They sound very abstract and interesting. Sounds like the book even has a two variations and another book will be Kickstarted in the future with more detailed rules.
