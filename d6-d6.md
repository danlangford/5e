I was first introduced to this mechanic by the [Open Adventure](http://geekguild.com/openadventure/) RPG I have since learned that the FATE system uses fudge dice that are essentially d3-d3. 

This mechanic generates both positive and negative numbers centered on 0 and are great for modifiers to some ability or skill.
