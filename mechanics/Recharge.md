title: Recharge

When something is expended roll to see if it can be re-used.

> Poison Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).

This ability available on the Young Green Dragon. The dragon has this available at least once. Once used the DM rolls a d6. If it lands 5 or 6 then it has recharged for another use. 

This is also seen with multi-charge wands with wording similar to "when you use the final charge roll a d20, on a 1 the wand is destroyed"

I initially encountered this mechanic on creatures in 5e as a way to limit their abilities without causing the DM to track so many different resource states.
