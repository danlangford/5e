## Damage and Healing

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright, as explained in the PHB or you are **Dying**, as explained in the following sections.

<div class='descriptive'>

#### Summary
---
- **Drop to 0 HP:** you are **Dying**, suffer **+2 Exhaustion**
- **End of turn:** suffer **+1 Exhaustion**
- **Take Damage:** suffer **+1 Exhaustion**, **+2** on a crit
- **Stabilized:** actions to stabilize **restores 1 HP** to the **Dying**
- **Regain any HP:** no longer **Dying**, gained **Exhaustion** remains

</div>

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you outright, you are **Dying**. You immediately suffer two levels of exhaustion. If you were already suffering from exhaustion you suffer two additional levels. If your exhaustion level is less than six then you are still conscious and still able to take actions within the limits of your current level of exhaustion. Please retreat.

When your turn ends if you are **Dying** you suffer an additional level of exhaustion. If that grants you the sixth level of exhaustion you are dead. Consult with your DM about generating a new character.

> Your DM may choose to have your declared deity offer your passing spirit a final bargain in order to return to life with one hit point and two levels of exhaustion. Beware, however, as this bargain should contain a major mechanical disability such as blindness or permanent exhaustion, in addition to a curse or a looming expiration date.

**Dying** ends if you regain any hit points. When this ends any amount of exhaustion gained from **Dying** does not end unless the healing method specifically describes also removing levels of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from **Dying** is like all other exhaustion. See _Exhaustion_ in _Conditions_ for information on removing levels of exhaustion.

##### Damage while Dying.

If you take any damage while you are **Dying**, you suffer an additional level of exhaustion. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two additional levels of exhaustion. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

##### Stabilizing a Dying Creature.

The best way to save a **Dying** creature is to heal it. Spells and abilities that "stabilize" a create now heal the creature for one hit point including administering first aid.

You can use your action to administer first aid to a dying creature, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
