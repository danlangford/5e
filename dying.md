# Dying

> #### Goals
> - encourage characters to leave a fight when they get low on health
> - maintain characters choice and agency and gameplay
> - provide opportunities for interesting choices and narrative

Falling unconcious is good because it takes a player out of the fight and raises a clear concern. It is also bad because it removes the players ability to fix the problem, play the game, or have any fun. The rules below will keep the good and get rid of the bad. They will produce more cinematic deaths in which a character rapidly degrades while screaming for their life and grasping for straws. The rules encourage a player to leave a fight when they are hanging by a thread but still permit them to act and attempt to save themselves.

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature drops to 0 hit points, it either dies outright due to the extreme amount of damage (PHB ch9) or becomes **Dying**, as explained in the following sections.

The blow that drops a creature to 0 hit points has a significant impact on them. It may be narativly appropriate to have the creature fall prone in response or suffer additional conditions such as stunned or frightened.

## Dying Condition

**Dying** is a special condition that replaces the idea of death saving throws. A creature that drops to 0 hit points immediatly suffers the **Dying** condition. When a creature has more than 0 hit points the creature immediatly looses the **Dying** condition. Any creature that has 0 hit points and is still alive always has the **Dying** condition.

Upon receiving the **Dying** condition the creature immediately suffers two levels of exhaustion. If the creature was already suffering from exhaustion they suffer two additional levels. If the exhaustion level is less than six then the creature is still conscious and still able to take actions within the limits of their current level of exhaustion. Please retreat.

When your turn ends if you are **Dying** you suffer an additional level of exhaustion. If that grants you the sixth level of exhaustion you are dead. Consult with your DM about generating a new character.

> Your DM may choose to have your declared deity offer your passing spirit a final bargain in order to return to life with one hit point and two levels of exhaustion. Beware, however, as this bargain should contain a major mechanical disability such as blindness or permanent exhaustion, in addition to a curse or a looming expiration date.

**Dying** ends if you regain any hit points. When this ends any amount of exhaustion gained from **Dying** does not end unless the healing method specifically describes also removing levels of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from **Dying** is like all other exhaustion. See _Exhaustion_ in _Conditions_ for information on removing levels of exhaustion.

The goal is to create a scenario where the character knows they are on their way to death and has multiple rounds to either stop the death or go out with a bang. These rules create a panic in the character without removing their abiulity to do something about it. Incombination with existing rules about removing level of exhaustion this creates a scenario where the closer you got to death to longer your character takes to recover from the shock of that situation. It could take multiple days to fully recover. During that time the character will have some disadvantage on checks and reduced speed (as per the exhaustion levels) and this represents a bit of shell shock or PTSD being suffered by the character.

### Damage while Dying.

If you take any damage while you are **Dying**, you suffer an additional level of exhaustion. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two additional levels of exhaustion. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

### Stabilizing a Dying Creature.

The best way to save a **Dying** creature is to heal it. Spells and abilities that "stabilize" a create now heal the creature for one hit point including administering first aid.

You can use your action to administer first aid to a dying creature, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Creatures that live after having the **Dying** condition have been at deaths door. Thats a very traumatic situation. It may be appropriate for the DM to roll on the "Lingering Injuries Table" (DMG ch9) for the creature.  

### Optional: Boromirs Heroic Death 

If you are **Dying** as an action you can have a Heroic Death. Consult with the DM the effects of this Heroic Death. The goal is to go out in guts and glory possibly swaying the tide of battle. The result will be at least your death of which you cannot be revived or resurrected. You have willingly departed this realm and cannot return.

Consider the final moments of Boromir (LOTR) where, filled with arrows, he makes multiple resurgances killing many more Orcs and setting up Lurtz to be ambushed. Or consider Leslie Coffelt (IRL) who was shot 3 times and limping along returned fire killing his assailant and successfully defending President Truman from assassination before passing out and dying.  

## Optional: Removing Exhaustion 
When you spend a Hit Die and you roll maximum value your current exhaustion level is reduced one level. 

This can make the effects of the **Dying** condition not last so long.
