## Progress Clocks

Pulled from Blades in the Dark this is a simple mechanic to track progress over time.
The GM will decide how much time investment will be required to complete the task.
A pie-chart is drawn.
It is expected that approximately 1 downtime activity each long rest will be spent towards this goal.
DM will likely call for an Ability Check to determine success of progress attempt.
More progress can be made by spending more time or obtaining a critical success on a Check.
