Introduced to me in D&D 5e it is simply rolling 2 dice, where you would have typically rolled just 1, and using the highest of the two rolls (advantage) or the lowest (disadvantage).

> PC: can I tell which direction they went?

> DM: roll a wisdom (perception) check to find out

> PC: I had previously Wild Shaped into a wolf. Do my Keen senses apply here?

> DM: oh right. Yes if you are hearing or smelling you can roll with advantage.

> PC: Iâ€™ll smell. I rolled a 12  and a 15. So 15 plus my perception (+4) is 19 total

a lighter variation of the [highest 1 in pool](highestinpool.md) mechanic
