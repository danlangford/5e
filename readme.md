# 5e House Rules and Campaign Notes

This document presents house rules that may be found in a campaign run by Dan '8bagels'. The goal of their design is to promote fun, collaboration, simplicity, elegance, grit, and interesting player choices.

Also there contains some campaign notes in [The Story](thestory.md) 

Many of these rules rely on a couple of foundations from the PHB and DMG:

- creatures can only gain the benefits of a long rest once per 24 hours
- the game is designed around ~2 encounters per short rest and ~6-8 encounters per long rest

And some rules leverage each other so consider that:

- each long rest you DO NOT get full HP regained
- Hit Dice are a shared resource used in multiple mechanics
