==== Time

The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand.

In a dungeon environment, the adventurersâ€™ movement happens on a scale of **minutes**.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on **rounds**, a 6-second span of time described in <<Chapter09>>.
