=== Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores

Abilities are given scores to describe a creatureâ€™s characteristics:

- *Strength*, measuring physical power
- *Dexterity*, measuring agility
- *Constitution*, measuring endurance
- *Intelligence*, measuring reasoning and memory
- *Wisdom*, measuring perception and insight
- *Charisma*, measuring force of personality

Reliant on the ability scores are the three main rolls of the game:

- the ability check
- the saving throw
- the attack roll

To perform these rolls:

1. roll a d20
2. add an ability modifier derived from one of the ability scores
3. compare the total to a target number

This chapter focuses on ability checks and saving throws. Rules for attack rolls appear in <<Chapter09>>.
