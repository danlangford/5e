==== Movement

The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times. Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes.

===== Speed

The distance in feet that a creature can walk in 1 round.


====== Travel Pace

Forced March:: Traveling beyond 8 hours in a day. After each additional hour of travel characters CON Save (DC=2+total hours traveled) against one level of exhaustion (see <<AppendixA>>).

Mounts and Vehicles:: Characters can ride at a gallop for up to an hour to double their fast pace. Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see <<Chapter05>>), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.

====== Difficult Terrain

Move at half speed -- moving 1 foot costs 2 feet of speed.

===== Special Types of Movement

====== Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain). You ignore this if you have and use a relevant speed (e.g. climbing or swimming speed). At the DM's option this may require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
