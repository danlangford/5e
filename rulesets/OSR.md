## OSR

To get a OSR or B/X feel consider using the following tradition and 5e variant rules.

Character Creation

* roll [3d6InOrder](../rules/3d6InOrder.md) for ability score
* select only from races and classes in the free [D&D 5e Basic Rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)
* use the DMG variant rule that grants characters proficiency in two abilities. This removes the use of skills from the game
* consider removing or limiting the use of cantrips
* every adventurer is given the standard adventuring gear pack
* may want to toss in some pitons and a 10ft pole
* drive for the general use of abilities and have players request use of a proficiency
