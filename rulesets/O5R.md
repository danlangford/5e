To get a OSR or B/X or BECMI(Cyclopedia) feel consider using the following traditions and 5e variant rules.

Character Creation

* roll [3d6InOrder](../rules/3d6InOrder.md) for ability score
* select only from races and classes in the free [D&D 5e Basic Rules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)
* Remove skills from the game and consider using the DMG variant rule that grants characters some proficient rolls based on Class, Background, or Personality Traits
* every adventurer is given the standard adventuring gear pack
* may want to toss in some pitons and a 10ft pole

Gameplay

* consider removing or limiting the use of cantrips (Spell casting modifier + Proficiency uses per day)
* drive for the general use of abilities and have players request use of a proficiency
* Use DMG Variant rules for Resting that takes a Long Rest up to an entire week. 
* Use the DMG Morale option (DC10 Wis save) for monsters when surprised, forces half defeated, or obviously defeated
* Grant XP for each GP returned to safety 

I plan to try some of these out and generate a more firm listing of tried practices.
