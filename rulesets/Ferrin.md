## Ferrin Ruleset

This rule set is a collection of rules we are using that vary from standard 5e.

- traditional XP leveling
- standard (avg) HP increase per level
- stats via 4d6 drop lowest OR Point Buy
- for critical hits use [DoubleDamagePlus](../rules/DoubleDamagePlus.md)
- for combat Initiative use [SideInitiativePlus](../rules/SideInitiativePlus.md)
- when you drop to Zero Hit Points use [Dying](../rules/Dying.md) rules (this may still be in discussion)
