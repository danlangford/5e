title: EMX-ICS Ruleset
---

This rule set is a collection of rules we are using that vary from standard 5e.

- participation/token leveling
- standard (avg) HP increase per level
- stats via Point Buy
- for critical hits use [DoubleDamagePlus](../rules/DoubleDamagePlus.md)
- for combat Initiative use [SideInitiativePlus](../rules/SideInitiativePlus.md)
- when you drop to Zero Hit Points use [Dying](../rules/Dying.md) rules (this may still be in discussion)
- players can participate in [Harvesting](../rules/Harvesting.md)
