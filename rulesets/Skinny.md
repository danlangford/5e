A **Player Character (PC)**, or adventurer, has six main abilities

 - **STRength** - Athletics
 - **DEXterity** - Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth
 - **CONstitution** - Endurance
 - **INTelligence** - Investigation, History
 - **WISdom** - Perception, Insight
 - **CHArisma** - Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion

Each has an **ability modifier** (MOD) to altar dice rolls. _Create a PC by assigning the following modifiers to the abilities of your choice: +2, +2, +1, +1, 0, -1._

When an outcome is unsure roll a d20⬡ and add an ability modifier trying to meet or exceed a target. i.e., `d20⬡+MOD≥TARGET` where MOD is STR, DEX, etc.

Rolls to cause harm are called **attacks** and target an **Armor Class (AC)**. Rolls to resist effects are called **saves**.  Rolls to do other tasks are called **checks**. Rolling saves and checks target a **Difficulty Class (DC)** (10=Easy, 15=Medium, 20=Hard, 25=Very Hard) or a contested roll by another character.

When a PC is proficient at a task add a d4△ **proficiency bonus** to rolls. `d20⬡+d4△+MOD` _Choose 1 ability the PC will usually be proficient in._

Some situations help or hurt your chances.  
**ADVantage**: use the best of 2 d20⬡ rolls.  
**DISadvantage**: use the worst of 2 d20⬡ rolls.  
ADV and DIS do not stack and cancel each other out.
