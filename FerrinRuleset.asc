== Ferrin Ruleset

This rule set is a collection of rules we are using that vary from standard 5e.

- traditional XP leveling
- standard (avg) HP increase per level
- stats via 4d6 drop lowest OR Point Buy
- for critical hits use <<DoubleDamagePlus>>
- for combat Initiative use <<SideInitiativePlus>>
- when you drop to Zero Hit Points use <<Dying>> rules (this may still be in discussion)

Let's include some of these rules below for quick reference.
