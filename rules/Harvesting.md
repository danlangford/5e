title: Harvesting
---

Some thoughts from todays session:

you can harvest non-human non-beast creatures that have been dead no longer than (some time)

it takes a medicine and nature check, maybe also another narrativly appropriate check (strength, slight of hand, constitution)

checks should dictate your choices, knowledge, and your success. 

high checks should let you target specific abilities. 

you are trying to extract something. claw, tooth, organ, etc. 

failure means you take damage equal to the total number of hit dice of that creature. 
also, a failure will cause the creature to no longer be harvestable. or that ability from the creature to not be harvestable

success grants you and item with X charges, determined by a roll of the creatures hit dice

OR

you get an item with 1 charge that recharges on a roll of the creature hit dice

once charges are expended or a recharge fails the item explodes dealing a single roll of the creatures hit dice

lots of room for narrative creativity on top of the framework. the character could consume or just extract a portion of the creature. 

TODO: determine steps required to add the gained abilities to an item/weapon permenantly
