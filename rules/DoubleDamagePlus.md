### Double Damage Plus

When you score a critical hit we want to always make it feel critical. 5e rules state that you roll all of your damage dice twice. But since you can still roll low and I have a tendency to run my monsters tough I like to allow for bigger critical hits.

> When you score a critical hit calculate the damage like normal and then add to that the max value of all the dice rolled.

or said another way

> When you score a critical hit causing you to roll all your damage dice twice, the second roll of the damage dice always land on their largest possible value.

If the PCs use this rule so do the monsters. 

does the underlying mechanic need a name? like "PlusMax"?
