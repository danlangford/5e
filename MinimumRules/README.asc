= Minimum Rules

== Basics



== Abilities

Example Abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma

Each will have a score up to 20.

Ability Modifiers(MOD): STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA = (AbilityScore-10)/2

When these rules need a number they may use the Ability name (e.g. Strength) as a reference to the Ability Score and the Ability abbreviation (e.g. STR) to reference the Ability Modifier.

=== Rolling Ability Checks and Saving Throws

Roll:: ability check, saving throw, or attack roll.

Perform a Roll: Roll+MOD>=Target (e.g. Roll+STR) means to roll a d20, add an Ability Modifier (and other applicable bonuses), and compare the result to a target to determine success.

A Roll typically has (1d20 + MOD) or (1d20 + MOD + Prof)

A Roll can have up to 2d20 (in which only 1 is used a la Adv/Dis), 0-1 MODs, 0-1 Profs, any number of other circumstantial modifiers from the DM, any number of other dice from spells or class features.

Advantage(Adv):: Roll with highest of 2d20 (non-stackable)
Disadvantage(Dis):: Roll with lowest of 2d20 (non-stackable)

Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out

Using Inspiration grants Advantage on the Roll.

Proficiency Bonus (Prof):: a bonus (non-stackable) to a Roll determined by character level representing specific training. It the Players duty to request +Prof on a Roll.
Ability Check:: Roll+MOD>=DC for non-attack task if failure is possible. DM determines MOD and DC.
Difficulty Class (DC):: 10=Easy, 20=Hard, 30=Nearly Impossible
Contest:: (Roll+MOD) > (Roll+MOD). Opponents make Ability Check against each other. DM determines MOD, may be different for each opponent. Ties result in no progress.
Skills:: Specific training that a player may be Proficient in often represented as a subset of an Ability or a toolset.
Passive Check:: 10+MOD. Optionally also +Prof and replace Adv/Dis with +5/-5.
Assisting:: If two characters are capable of performing the task individually then one of them may make the Ability Check with Advantage.
Group Check:: Half of the group needs individual Ability Check successes for the entire group to succeed.
Saving Throw:: an attempt to resist a threat. Roll+MOD to save. A characters class may give them proficiency in saves of a specific ability.

=== Specific Rules built on Abilities

Carrying Capacity (S/M):: Strength x 15 lbs
Push, Drag, or Lift (S/M):: Strength x 30 lbs

For each size away from Small/Medium multiply or divide those numbers by 2. e.g. a Huge creature can Lift (Strength x 15 x 4) lbs and a Tiny creature can Carry (Strength x 15 / 2) lbs.

Armor Class (AC):: Depending on the armor you may add some or all of DEX to your AC.
Initiative:: Roll+DEX to determine combat order.
