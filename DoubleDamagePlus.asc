== Double Damage Plus

When you score a critical hit we want to always make it feel critical. 5e rules state that you roll all of your damage dice twice. But since you can still roll low and I have a tendency to run my monsters tuff I like to allow for bigger critical hits.

When you score a ciritcal hit calculate the damage like normal and then add to that the max value of all the dice rolled.

or said another way

When you score a critical hit causing you to roll all your damage dice twice, the damage dice always land on their largest possible value on the second roll
