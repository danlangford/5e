## 5e Pacing

According to the 5e PHB (or DMG?) creatures can only gain the benefits of a long rest once per 24 hours.

Also, the game is designed around ~2 encounters per short rest and ~6-8 encounters per long rest

These rules are commonly overlooked even though they play a large role in the balance of 5e.
