== Spell Points

Spell Points in the DMG are not easy to manage due to the complex costs and tables. This attempts to simplify the calculation of points at the cost of possibly not being as balanced. 

=== Set In Stone

Max Spell Level = Class Level / 2 (round up)

=== Still Up For Debate

Spell Points / day = Class Level x Spell Casting Modifier

Spell Cost = Spell Level

Casting a spell of level greater than Spell Casting Modifier requires a Spell Casting Ability check where DC = 10+Spell Level

Example: Chad had multi-classed as Wizard 9 Fighter 2. His Intelligence modifier is 5. Each day he has 9\*5=45 spell points. He can cast spells up to spell level 9/2(round up)=5. A Spell costs its level so he could cast 9 level 5 spells, 11 level 4 spells, or 45 level 1 spells. 

Regaining spells on a short rest.
