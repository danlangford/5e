## Advantage/Disadvantage

Introduced to me in D&D 5e it is simply rolling 2 dice, where you would have typically rolled just 1, and using the highest of the two rolls (advantage) or the lowest (disadvantage).

> PC: can I tell which direction they went?
>
> DM: roll a Wisdom (Perception) check to find out
>
> PC: I had previously Wild Shaped into a Wolf. Do my Keen senses apply here?
>
> DM: Yes, if you are hearing or smelling you can roll with advantage.
>
> PC: Iâ€™ll smell. I rolled a 12 and a 15. So 15 plus my Wisdom (Perception) modifier of (+4) is 19
