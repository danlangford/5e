# 5e House Rules

>⚠️: This page is by default not rendered and not accessible via the hosted jekyll site. Im ok with this. This allows me to put a more dev centric README here for the author and a more player centric welcome in the index

## Introduction

These documents present house rules that may be found in a campaign run by Dan '8bagels'.
The goal of their design is to promote fun, collaboration, simplicity, elegance, grit, and interesting player choices.


| Feature                        | Description
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------
| [Mechanics](mechanics/index.md)| little building blocks of a game
| [Rules](rules/index.md)        | rules use mechanics to resolve questions
| [Rulesets](rulesets/index.md)  | collections of rules for a specific tone, campaign, table, group, etc.
| [TheWorld](TheWorld.md)        |


## Common Icons

The following callouts may appear throughout the text. 

| Icon | Code | Usage
|------|-------|---
| {{site.TIP}}  | `{{site.TIP}}`  | Tip/Ideas
| {{site.INFO}} | `{{site.INFO}}` | Note/Info
| {{site.WARN}} | `{{site.WARN}}` | Warning/Caution
| {{site.TODO}} | `{{site.TODO}}` | To ~~Do~~ Edit
| {{site.FIXME}} | `{{site.FIXME}}` | Needs fixing

## Progress

as you are progressing through all the current articles making predefined enhancments you can use the [Real Index](realindex.md). Called such because its actually an index... and not the first page you see when you hit the site. 

## TODO

- [x] consider a TOC solution
- [ ] make each page more like a "blog post"
- [ ] leverage jekyll categories/tags 
- [x] decide which callout icons you like. consider your ascii editor, your markdown preview, running jekyll locally, and the deployed version
- [ ] rely LESS on include_relative
