# 5e House Rules

>⚠️: This page is by default not rendered and not accessible via the hosted jekyll site. Im ok with this. This allows me to put a more dev centric README here for the author and a more player centric welcome in the index

## Introduction

These documents present house rules that may be found in a campaign run by Dan '8bagels'.
The goal of their design is to promote fun, collaboration, simplicity, elegance, grit, and interesting player choices.


| Feature                     | Description

| [HouseRules](rules/index.md) | rules use mechanics to resolve questions
| [RealRules](rules/RealRules.md)   | overlooked or optional rules from designers

## Progress

as you are progressing through all the current articles making predefined enhancments you can use the [Real Index](realindex.md). Called such because its actually an index... and not the first page you see when you hit the site. 

## TODO

- [x] consider a TOC solution
- [ ] make each page more like a "blog post"
- [ ] leverage jekyll categories/tags 
- [x] decide which callout icons you like. consider your ascii editor, your markdown preview, running jekyll locally, and the deployed version
- [ ] rely LESS on include_relative
