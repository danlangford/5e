## Strongholds

currently using "Walrock" aka {WH} strongholds documents (dmsguild) these are built room-by-room each giving bonuses to checks often done in downtime (e.g. making potions, doing research)

interested in Coleville Stronghold and Followers rules from his kickstarter. These are now obtained but not yet consumed. These are built as individual buildings (multiple can be combined into a castle) and focus on giving bonuses in combat.
