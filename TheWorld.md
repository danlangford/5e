## Phandalin region

Barthens shop was destroyed. A Green dragon still lingers to the north. Eldrazi were discovered in the Lost Mines/Wave Echo. The Lost Mines have been reestablished as a place for creating magic items.  And there have been some strange sightings of a girl and her crazy father hustling back and forth.

Rumors exist of a white dragon in the mountains that is causing some local disruption. 
  
The Goblins near the road to Phandalin have been reformed by the Cleric Thor. 

The Cragmaw Castle has recently been subjected to severe fires and explosions. 

## Neverwinter

A flying tower was recently falling towards neverwinter. A brave group of adventurers managed to barely steer it clear of the city walls where it crashed into a hillside, but seems to be mostly intact.
Neverwinter has had a very tight restriction on magic items enforced by the government to "protect" magic item owners ever since so many magic items went stolen. Many of the noteable magic items were only recently recovered from White Plum Mountain

## Chult

A disease is spreading through the jungle, branching out from a single point deep in the jungle. At that point you would find various denizens encased within large obsidian pillars. 

## Thay

The Doomvault was recently infiltrated. Their demon spawning operations ceased when the vault collapsed. It in theory would be possible to return to further explore it mysteries, though it would be much more dangerous now. 

## Dragon Coast

The Tomb of the Serpent kings has be discovered. Westgate is recovering from a massive fire last year. 

## Misc

Beware the orange stick.
